This book covers the fundamental concepts, technologies, standards, and system design aspects of wireless communications. It provides a thorough overview of the key wireless technologies, such as voice, data, cordless, paging, fixed and mobile broadband wireless systems. It also explains the wireless system design fundamentals, such as channel assignment, handoffs, trunking efficiency, interference, frequency reuse, capacity planning, large-scale fading, and more. Moreover, it covers the topics of path loss, small-scale fading, multipath, reflection, diffraction, scattering, shadowing, spatial-temporal channel modeling, and microcell/indoor propagation. Furthermore, it discusses the techniques of modulation, equalization, diversity, channel coding, and speech coding. Additionally, it introduces the new wireless LAN technologies, such as IEEE 802.11a/b, HIPERLAN, BRAN, and other alternatives. It also presents the new 3G air interface standards, such as W-CDMA, cdma2000, GPRS, UMTS, and EDGE. Finally, it explores the emerging technologies of Bluetooth wearable computers, fixed wireless and Local Multipoint Distribution Service (LMDS), and other advanced technologies.
