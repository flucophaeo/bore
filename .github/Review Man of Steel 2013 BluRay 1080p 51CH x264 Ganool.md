The film tells the origin story of Superman, who was born on the dying planet Krypton and sent to Earth by his parents. He grows up with a sense of isolation and confusion about his true identity and purpose. He eventually learns of his alien heritage and his extraordinary abilities. He also faces a threat from his fellow Kryptonians led by General Zod, who seek to terraform Earth and eradicate humanity.
 
Man of Steel was released on June 14, 2013 in North America and received mixed reviews from critics and audiences. Some praised the film's action sequences, visual effects, score by Hans Zimmer, and performances by Cavill and Shannon, while others criticized the film's dark tone, lack of humor, excessive destruction, and deviation from the traditional Superman mythology. The film was a box office success, grossing over $668 million worldwide against a budget of $225 million.

Man of Steel is not a typical Superman film. It is darker, grittier, and more realistic than the previous adaptations. It also explores the themes of identity, destiny, choice, and morality. The film shows how Clark Kent struggles to find his place in the world and to accept his responsibility as a hero. He also faces moral dilemmas and ethical challenges as he confronts Zod and his army.
 
The film also features a different portrayal of Superman's relationship with Lois Lane. In this version, Lois is an investigative reporter who tracks down Clark's identity and helps him expose Zod's plan. She also knows his secret from the beginning and supports him throughout the film. Their romance is more subtle and less cheesy than in the previous films.
 
Man of Steel also has some controversial aspects that divided fans and critics. One of them is the depiction of Krypton, which is shown as a highly advanced but decadent and oppressive society. Another one is the portrayal of Jonathan Kent, who is more protective and pessimistic than in the comics. He even suggests that Clark should hide his powers and let people die rather than reveal himself to the world. The most controversial aspect, however, is the ending of the film, where Superman kills Zod by snapping his neck. This act goes against the traditional code of Superman, who never kills his enemies.
